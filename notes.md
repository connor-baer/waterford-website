#EMAIL

Good afternoon, 

We are about to switch to the upgraded version of the new Waterford website. Based on the feedback that we received since the launch of the website in February, I have made numerous improvements to make the website more user-friendly and easier to maintain. 

The most notable changes are: The sub-navigation is now part of the navigation bar at the top and no longer in the footer to make it more accessible. The frontpage received a make over, with the news now being displayed under the top slides. There is also an optional notice bar that can be used to display urgent announcements on the frontpage. Header images are now taller to eliminate awkward cropping of photos. Social sharing buttons are more prominent and on more pages. Overall, the site loads about 10% faster.

My main focus was to make the management of the website easier. I added help text and word limits to most input fields. I removed unnecessary fields on news posts (excerpts are now automatically created from the article). Generally many things are now automated. The website is now optimized for discovery and display by search engines. YouTube videos and photo galleries with one, two and three pictures can be added to articles and block posts. And finally we switched to a faster and more powerful server. 

A full changelog is below. It can take up to 48 hours for the domain to direct to the new server, but there will be no downtime. If you would like to see the upgraded website now, you can go to http://46.101.203.64/ in your browser.

I am looking forward to your feedback! 

Cheers,
Connor
